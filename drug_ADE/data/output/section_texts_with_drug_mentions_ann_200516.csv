Las guías chinas recomiendan nebulización con IFN-␣2b 100.000-200.000 UI/kg para casos leves, y 200.000-400.000 UI/kg para casos severos, 2 veces/día durante 5-7 días. • El lopinavir es un inhibidor de la proteasa utilizado para tratar la infección por VIH, con ritonavir como potenciador. Lopinavir y/o lopinavir/ritonavir tienen actividad frente al coronavirus in vitro. En el tratamiento del SRAS, en Hong Kong se encontró que, en comparación con la ribavirina sola, los pacientes tratados con lopinavir/ritonavir y ribavirina tenían un menor riesgo de SDRA o muerte 33, 34 . • Remdesivir podría ser el mejor fármaco potencial para el tratamiento de COVID-19. Es un antiviral desarrollado para el Ébola, profármaco análogo de nucleótido. Experimentos con animales han demostrado que en comparación con el grupo de control, remdesivir puede reducir eficazmente el título de virus de ratones infectados con MERS-CoV así como mejorar el daño del tejido pulmonar y su efecto es mejor que el del grupo tratado con lopinavir/ritonavir combinado con IFN-␤. El medicamento ha completado el ensayo clínico de fase III para el tratamiento de la infección por el virus del Ébola, y los datos de farmacocinética y seguridad están relativamente completos. Sin embargo, la eficacia y la seguridad de remdesivir en pacientes con infección COVID-19 aún deben confirmarse. Este fármaco no está disponible en España. En Estados Unidos se ha empleado en al menos un caso con buenos resultados 35, 36 . Se podrá solicitar como uso compasivo a la AEMPS.

Abstract: On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has presented rapid person-to-person transmission and is currently a global pandemic. In the largest number of cases described to date of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease (2019-nCoViD), 26% required care in an intensive care unit (ICU).

Evitar tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca antes de lavarse las manos. 2. Debe realizarse la limpieza habitual de las superficies de la casa regularmente. Limpie y desinfecte objetos y superficies que se toquen con frecuencia. 3. Evite el contacto o mantenga una distancia de al menos 2 m con personas que padecen síntomas de infección respiratoria (fiebre, tos, dolores musculares generalizados, dolor de garganta o dificultad respiratoria), y no comparta con ellas las pertenencias personales. 4. Durante el estado de alarma, se debe permanecer en el domicilio salvo las excepciones estipuladas, según las normas establecidas por las autoridades políticas y sanitarias. Avise telefónicamente a la consulta de trasplante renal de su centro de referencia o a los teléfonos habilitados por las autoridades sanitarias. 5. Trate de seguir una correcta alimentación. Evite el consumo de tabaco y alcohol. Además de ser perjudiciales para la salud, estas sustancias debilitan el sistema inmunológico, por lo que el organismo es más vulnerable ante enfermedades infecciosas. 6. Evite compartir comida y utensilios (cubiertos, vasos, servilletas, pañuelos, etc y otros objetos sin limpiarlos debidamente. 7. Los centros para la prevención y control de enfermedades (CDC, del inglés Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) no recomiendan en población general que las personas que estén bien usen una máscara facial para protegerse de las enfermedades respiratorias, incluido el COVID-19. A día de hoy, la población trasplantada renal debe cumplir las medidas de protección recomendadas en la población general, especialmente si están asintomáticas en su domicilio. No obstante, los facultativos responsables recomendarán de manera individualizada el empleo de mascarilla, principalmente en los casos donde el paciente acuda a un centro sanitario u otro lugar de aglomeración.

Objetivo: Revisar la evidencia científica disponible relacionada con el cuidado del sistema respiratorio, estableciendo pautas generales de tratamiento. Métodos: Revisión narrativa de la literatura. Se realizó una búsqueda, selección y revisión de artículos originales y secundarios escritos en inglés o español, en las diferentes bases de datos: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE y EMBASE publicados hasta marzo del 2020. Resultados: no se ha definido un tratamiento especifico ante la nueva enfermedad, teniendo como principal medida terapéutica el control sintomático. Utilizar elementos de bioseguridad: gafas, gorros, guantes, bata larga impermeable, tapabocas alta eficiencia en personal sanitario (FFP2 o N95), en paciente sintomático utilizar tapabocas quirúrgico, jabón hospitalario, toallas de papel, y alcohol al 70% o isopropilico. Utilizar oxígeno mediante sistemas de bajo flujo. En ventilación mecánica programar modos VCP o VCV, Vt: 4-6 ml/Kg, Fr: ≤ 35, FiO2: para PaO2=60 mmHg o SpO2: 92-96%, PEEP: 12-17 cmH2O, Ventilación prono si PAFI ≤ 150 con relación 16/8 o 18/6, óxido nítrico: 5-20 ppm. Conclusiones: Usar equipos de bioseguridad con el fin de interrumpir la transmisión, en hipoxemia usar sistemas de oxigenoterapia bajo flujo. Usar estrategias de protección pulmonar, disminución de volúmenes corrientes, presiones de plateau y frecuencias respiratorias, implementación de valores de PEEP elevados, bajos valores de presión de conducción y ventilación en prono, los cuales han demostrado mejoraría en la hipoxemia y la sobrevida en pacientes con SDRA.","alcohol,nf,rid",3

Escherichia coli O157:H7 in a food model.25
Moreover, Wodek et al. indicated that allyl disulfide can constitute a source of sulfane
sulfur for liver; therefore, it can be used for cyanide detoxification in mouse
tissues.22 Methyl allyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide were
inhibitory agents against Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and
Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) for contact toxicity, fumigant toxicity,
and antifeedant activity.23 Besides, according to Seki et al., the
anticancer effect of diallyl trisulfide on cancer cells HCT-15 and DLD-1 was
reported.24 The biological activities of the essential oil depend on
the number of sulfur atoms, and the higher the number of sulfur atoms, the stronger the

Le traitement adjuvant recommandé et débuté idéalement dans les quatre semaines après la chirurgie est : pour les cancers triples négatifs pT1N0 et en l'absence de contre-indication en évaluant le rapport bénéfice/risque : quatre cycles de docétaxel (75 mg/m 2 ) et cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m 2 ) avec facteurs de croissance de la lignée blanche. Pour les cancers HER2 positifs pT1N0 et en l'absence de contreindication en évaluant le rapport bénéfice/risque : quatre cycles de paclitaxel hebdomadaire (80 mg/m 2 ) avec trastuzumab (idéalement par voie sous-cutanée) toutes les trois semaines, puis trastuzumab pour un an. En l'absence de réactions allergiques après les deux premières injections de paclitaxel, l'administration de corticoïdes peut être suspendue [18] . Dans les autres cas, en situation néoadjuvante et adjuvante, les indications restent identiques. Cependant, nous rappelons plusieurs adaptations fortement recommandées : en cas de doute sur le bénéfice de la chimiothérapie adjuvante pour les cancers hormonodépendants, l'utilisation des signatures transcriptomiques pour la désescalade raisonnée de chimiothérapie aide à la prise de décision. En cas d'indication de chimiothérapie pour cette population, elle peut être différée jusqu'à six semaines après la chirurgie ; en cas d'indication de chimiothérapie, la pose d'un PAC® n'est pas contre-indiquée, mais ceux-ci étant souvent posés par des anesthésistes réanimateurs. Il est important d'anticiper leur pose dans le contexte d'une recrudescence des activités de réanimation liées à la pandémie ; privilégier l'administration à domicile des traitements de maintenance anti-HER2 ; éviter l'administration de corticoïdes à visée antiémétique ; utiliser des facteurs de croissance de la lignée blanche dès le risque intermédiaire de neutropénie [19] ; utiliser préférentiellement des schémas permettant de réduire le nombre de passages dans les hôpitaux (schémas toutes les trois semaines plutôt qu'hebdomadaires). Si un schéma par paclitaxel hebdomadaire est privilégié, en l'absence de réactions allergiques après les deux premières injections de paclitaxel, l'administration de corticoïdes peut être suspendue [17] ; une durée totale du traitement de chimiothérapie de 18 semaines doit être privilégiée (six cycles/trois semaines) ; l'utilisation d'un schéma dose-dense n'est pas contreindiquée ; l'utilisation de la capécitabine ou de T-DM1 en situation adjuvante en l'absence de pCR respectivement pour la population triple négative ou HER2 positive n'est pas contre-indiquée.

La collecte des échantillons de lavage broncho-alvéolaire ne doit normalement être effectuée que chez les patients ventilés mécaniquement, car les échantillons des voies respiratoires inférieures semblent rester positifs pendant une période plus longue. Les échantillons nécessitent un stockage à quatre degrés Celsius. En laboratoire, l'amplification du matériel génétique extrait de l'échantillon de salive ou de mucus se fait par une réaction en chaîne par polymérase inverse (RT-PCR). Si le résultat du test est positif, il est recommandé de répéter le test pour vérification. Chez les patients dont le diagnostic de COVID-19 a été confirmé, l'évaluation en laboratoire peut être répétée pour évaluer la clairance virale. Le diagnostic positif peut également être fortement évoqué par scanner sans injection. Les images scannographiques thoraciques de COVID-19 sont assez caractéristiques et différenciantes des autres pneumonies virales classiques ou d'atteintes pulmonaires liées à d'autres causes. Il s'agit d'une distribution périphérique, avec opacités en verre dépoli, opacités réticulaires fines et des épaississements vasculaires, avec peu d'extension centrale, absence d'épanchement pleural et de lymphadénopathie [5] .

Néanmoins, les cas ultérieurs n'étaient pas associés à ce mécanisme d'exposition et il a été conclu que le virus pouvait être transmis d'humain à humain. Comme pour les autres pathogènes respiratoires, dont la grippe et les rhinovirus, la transmission se produit par le biais de gouttelettes respiratoires provenant de la toux et des éternuements. La transmission d'aérosols est également possible en cas d'exposition prolongée à des concentrations élevées d'aérosols dans des espaces clos. L'analyse des données relatives à la propagation du SARS-CoV-2 en Chine semble indiquer qu'un contact étroit entre les individus est nécessaire. En fait, la propagation est principalement limitée aux membres de la famille, aux professionnels de la santé et à d'autres contacts étroits. Ces données suggèrent que l'utilisation de l'isolement est le meilleur moyen de contenir cette épidémie. Par ailleurs, comme les autres CoV, SARS-CoV-2 est sensible aux rayons ultraviolets, à la chaleur et peut être efficacement inactivé par des solvants lipidiques, comme l'éther (75 %), l'éthanol, les désinfectants contenant du chlore, l'acide peroxyacétique et le chloroforme, à l'exception de la chlorhexidine [3] .

Cette épidémie impose des bouleversements dans nos organisations en établissements de santé qui ne doivent pas occulter l'importance du soin nutritionnel pour tous les patients qui le nécessitent. Le diagnostic nutritionnel et la prise en charge nutritionnelle précoce des patients infectés Covid-19 doivent être intégrés dans la stratégie thérapeutique globale, comme pour toute situation aiguë d'agression métabolique. Ce document a été élaboré par la Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme (SFNCM) dans l'urgence de la crise sanitaire par un groupe d'experts, en se basant sur les recommandations nationales et internationales disponibles dans le domaine de la dénutrition, des états d'agression métaboliques aigus et de la réanimation à la date du 23 mars 2020. Nous espérons qu'il apportera aux professionnels de santé, surtout non spécialisés en nutrition, des repères utiles pour la prise en charge des patients hospitalisés, infectés ou non par le Covid-19, en cette période d'épidémie et de confinement intra-hospitalier. La prise en charge nutritionnelle est adaptée de façon graduée et personnalisée en fonction de la sévérité de la dénutrition, en accord avec l'arbre décisionnel du soin nutritionnel ( Figure   1 ) [5] : principalement, alimentation enrichie avec ou sans compléments nutritionnels oraux, ou nutrition entérale par sonde naso-gastrique. Les protocoles de traitement nutritionnel en vigueur dans l'établissement restent inchangés, mais leurs modalités pratiques peuvent se voir modifier durant la période d'épidémie: exemple : limitation des possibilités de consultation physique des équipes diététiques ou de l'unité transversale de nutrition, nécessitant de recourir à des consultations téléphoniques y compris en intra-établissement.
