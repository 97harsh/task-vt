Introduction:

This implementation attempts to detect negation in medical statements with a <drug> and <treatment> co-occurance. 
The stanfordCoreNLP server is used to tokenize and parse the text. A list of trigger terms that imply negation (https://github.com/ckbjimmy/clneg) is used as reference for negation detection.

Pros:

Cons:

Structure:

1. The 'data' folder contains:
	a. Input files containing text to be analysed for negation
	b. neg_list_complete.txt : A list of terms that imply negation, as per https://github.com/ckbjimmy/clneg
	c. stanford-corenlp-full-2018-02-27\ : Folder with supporting files for StanfordCoreNLP API call (follow instructions under setup to create this)
	d. output\ : Folder with output files containing an addiitonal column that specifies if the text is a negation
2. There are 3 notebooks:
	a. StanfordCoreNLP_Connector : Sets up the StanfordCoreNLP Server
	b. Task_1T.1.6 : For each input file, performs negation detection and creates an output file
			 Displays top 20 and negated and top 20 asserted drug names
	c. Evaluation : Calculates accuracy/precision/recall metrics for the negation detection output by comparing against human annotations

Setup:

1. Execute the following command line instructions under the data\ folder:
	wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-02-27.zip; \
	unzip stanford-corenlp-full-2018-02-27.zip; \
	rm stanford-corenlp-full-2018-02-27.zip; \
